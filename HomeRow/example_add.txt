ADDER PROGRAM.
INPUT TWO ONE-DIGIT NUMBERS ON SEPARATE LINES.
THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF THE ANSWER IS LESS THAN 10.


THIS IS A GOOD COMMENT STYLE. TO AVOID HAVING TO NOT USE A, S, D, F, G, J, K, AND L, SIMPLY USE UPPERCASE FOR COMMENTS.
HOWEVER, YOU CANNOT USE SEMICOLONS. IF YOU REALLY NEED SEMICOLONS OR LOWERCASE LETTERS, YOU CAN USE j AS AN ESCAPE CHARACTER,
BUT THAT ONLY WORKS IF THE CURRENT CELL IS ZERO, SO YOU SHOULD EITHER HAVE A DEDICATED ZERO CELL TO GO TO FOR COMMENTS,
OR ONLY USE THAT TECHNIQUE AT THE BEGINNING OF PROGRAMS. 
ALSO, YOU CAN PUT HEADER COMMENTS INSIDE OF LOWERCASE LS (SINCE BEFORE ANYTHING RUNS THE CELL IS GUARANTEED TO BE ZERO),
ALLOWING YOU TO USE LOWERCASE LETTERS AND SEMICOLONS.
EXAMPLE:
l
This is a mułtiłine header comment. Notice you wiłł have to put a stroke through any L's inside, uppercase them, or use some other
technique to make them not L's.
